# DevicesApp

##### This is a frontend	application	for managing a	list	of devices: desktops,	laptops	and	mobile	phones.

Related server application can be found here: https://github.com/AmitArbel/pan.server.assignment

##### Devices Cards:
Device has:	name, IP address,	type (workstation,	server,	mobile),	status (active,	inactive) and	randomly generated 5 events:	event	type	(security,	log),	severity (high,	medium,	low)	and	description	â€“ random text	like	lorem	ipsum. The device list	should	be	displayed	using	a	responsive	card design,	where	the	device	details	are	on	the	top	of the card while	the	device	events	in	the	footer	of	the	card.

User can	add	a	device using	a	button	which	will	display	a	form	that	contains	fields	for:	name,	IP. Once	saved, the device	will	be	added	to	the	card	list	with	random	generated	type,	status	and	events.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
